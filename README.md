## Simple working example of Google App Engine using Python. 

If you just want to see this code in action, you can go to [https://queue2-1203.appspot.com/]

## Building and running the code

Build the SDK by following this link:

* [https://cloud.google.com/appengine/downloads?hl=en]

Set the path to where the sdk is extracted.  We'll need to access the dev_appserver.py file.

Run the code:

* Extract the contents of this project to a new folder
* cd into the Source subdirectory of the folder you just created.
* Run the command 'dev_appserver.py .'

The app should start running and can be accessed via the webpage at localhost:8080/
